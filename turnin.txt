Turning in assignments using my "turnin" command. This command is found in
~mike.noel/bin/turnin.

It is simple to run, you just type:

~mike.noel/bin/turnin cs260 myfile.txt

[replace "cs260" with cs201, cs261, or whatever the correct class identifier
is.]

This will take care of everything. It will give you a "receipt" identifier
that you can keep if you want to have a record of turning in the file.

You can call this command as many times as you want. Each subsequent call does
not overwrite the previous one. 

If you have multiple files to turn in you can either call turnin multiple
times, once per file, or use zip or tar to create a single bundle and turn
that in. Either way is fine.

Finally, if you don't want to type ~mike.noel/bin everytime you can add that
directory to your path and then you only need to type "turnin class file" to
turn something in.
