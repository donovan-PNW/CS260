Keeping your files organized will make your life much easier as you go through
your Computer Science course. Everyone has a different style on how they like
to keep things in order and if you have a system that works for you already,
then feel free to use it. However, if you are new to Computer Science or
haven't kept your files organized in the past, follow these instructions for
setting up a directory structure that will make it easy to keep things
organized.

1) If you don't already have one, create a new directory for all your class
files. For example: "mkdir ~/classes/cs123". 

2) Go into your class directory. For example, if you used the directory
mentioned in step 1, the command would be "cd ~/classes/cs123".

3) Make a new directory for labs using the command "mkdir labs".

4) Repeat step #3 for "exams" and "assignments".

Now, when you are ready to start a new lab, exam, or assignment, go to the
appropriate directory in your class directory and use "mkdir" to make a new
directory for that new project.
