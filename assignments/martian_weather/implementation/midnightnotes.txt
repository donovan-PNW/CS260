YOU'RE DOING FINE!!!

the weatherdata class should be a simple template-style class that ONLY has integer values

then, the linkedlist class will have a node containing one individual weatherdata, and one pointer
like so

struct entrynode
{
    weatherdata thisEntry
    entrynode* nextTime
    entrynode* nextTemperature
    entrynode* nextWindspeed

}

Also, ask jony for help if you need to. 

ALSO CHECK OUT LINKEDLIST EXAMPLE FOR INSERT FUNCTION
In your version it would be IN the linkedlist class and it would be:
linkedlist::insert(const weatherdata& thisEntry)
so check out the & thing
OR maybe just have weatherdata fill, THEN call a linkedlist::copy(thisEntry) function from within weatherdata to copy it all over?
